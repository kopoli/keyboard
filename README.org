* Tool for setting up a custom keyboard layout in X

  I use this tool to set my keyboards to the following layout:

  [[./img/keyboard-layout.png]]

  This is a typical QWERTY layout with finnish configuration with the
  following changes:
  - Control_L replaces caps-lock.
  - Hyper_L replaces Control_L.
  - Tab and Meta_L are swapped.
  - Insert and pause-break buttons are swapped. This is for kinesis freestyle2
    where the insert button is behind a modal Fn key.
  - For Kinesis Freestyle2, reorganize the Home-column into the following
    order: Home, PageUp, PageDown, End

  A script (xkb-layout) is installed that changes the keyboard layout. Also a binary
  program (xkb-unlocker) is required to be compiled to disable possible caps
  lock if it is currently enabled.

** Requirements

  The following programs:

  - GNU Make
  - A C-compiler
  - libx11 development packages (for caps-lock unlocking)
  - xkbcomp
  - setxkbmap
  - notify-send (for displaying the changed keymap)
  - xkbprint
  - ps2pdf

** Usage / Installation

  The Makefile will install a wrapper for the script in BINDIR. It will also
  create *.desktop -files for the keyboard setting and install them into
  INSTDIR. Look into the Makefile.

  The following command compiles the xkb-unlocker, installs the wrapperscript,
  xkb-unlocker and and the desktop-files:

  #+begin_src shell
  make
  #+end_src

  This git repository needs to exist when running the wrapper script, because
  the keyboard configurations are kept in the keyboard/ subdirectory.

  You can change the keyboard layout with the following:
  
  #+begin_src shell
  xkb-layout
  #+end_src

  Give the --help -argument and the script will display an usage.

** Basic operation

  The script works by using xkbcomp to compile a keymap from configurations in
  the keyboard subdirectory. You can create your own keyboard configurations
  there.

** Displaying of the current keyboard layout

  You can create a PDF-image of the current keyboard layout with the
  following:

  #+begin_src shell
  make image
  #+end_src

  The first image is with no modifiers pressed, the following is with shift
  and thereafter is shift+alt-gr. The image will be similar to the one
  displayed in this README.
